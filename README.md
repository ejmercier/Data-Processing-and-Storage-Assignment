# Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment

To run the project please run the following commands to compile and run the code.

```javac Main.java```

```java Main```

If you don't have java installed please 
**Download JDK** by going to the [Oracle's Java SE Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and download the appropriate JDK for your operating system and follow the setup instructions to configure it for your machine.

# Suggestions
You could modify the transactions by adding more operations like delete to remove a key-value pair or containsKey to check if a key exists.
Also you could require Unit tests be written to prove the code works, and even put the unit tests into a github Action to work in that skill at the same time.
Overall I think it is a good assignment, however it may be hard to grade beacuse the grader must inspect and run every individual's code. Might be easier to have some sort of way to make a pull request to a repo and the pre-built automated tests tells you if the code is working.
